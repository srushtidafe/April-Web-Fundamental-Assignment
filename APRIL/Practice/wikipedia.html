                    Conquest of Torana: It was the first fort captured by Shivaji as Chieftain of Marathas which led to the foundation of his ruling attributes of valour and determination at the age of 16. This conquest drives him to capture another like Raigarh and Pratapgarh. Due to these conquests, the Sultan of Bijapur was getting panic and he put Shahji, Shivaji's father in prison. In AD 1659, Shivaji again tried to attack Bijapur then the Sultan of Bijapur sent his general, Afzal Khan, to capture Shivaji. But Shivaji managed to escape and killed him with a deadly weapon called Baghnakh or the tiger's claw. Finally, in 1662, the Sultan of Bijapur made a peace treaty with Shivaji and made him an independent ruler of his conquered territories.

This coronation gives a legitimate right to collect land revenue and levy tax on the people.
